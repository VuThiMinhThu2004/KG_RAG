    "Question": "Is the craniosynostosis seen in Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene?",
    "Golden": "No",
    "Answer": "Craniosynostosis is indeed associated with mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes the fibrillin-1 protein. Therefore, it can be inferred that craniosynostosis in Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome may be caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene. The association of craniosynostosis with the FBN1 gene is corroborated by the Provenance information stating its relevance (HPO).\n\nProvenance: HPO."
